# Portfolio Stress Test (ðŸš§ Work in Progress...)

I'm currently working on this project to analyze how a dummy portfolio will respond to crisis events using Monte Carlo simulation. I aim to:
1. Build 2 models (linear regression, random forest)
2. Cross-validate and find the best model (randomizedsearchCV, confusion matrix)
3. Backtest model using historical crisis events like the 2008 global recession
4. Forward test model using Monte Carlo simulation
5. Evaluate predictive accuracy and risk performance (max drawdown, Sharpe ratio, recovery time, VaR)
